This is the second assignment of the COMP2404 course at Carleton University. In this program we tackle implementing collections classes for managing a library system. These are collections that handle books, and patrons to the library.


HOW-TO

Navigate to the extracted folder in linux terminal and type 'make'. This will compile an executable.

Run the executable through the terminal with 
'./a2' command.


Navigate through the library using the menus provided, including adding patrons and checking out books.
